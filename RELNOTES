This document provides Release notes for Motif 2.1.30.
Please see the COPYRIGHT.MOTIF file included with this release.


Introduction

This document describes Motif version 2.1.30. Whenever "Motif"
is used in these release notes, it means Motif 2.1.30.

This document and accompanying text files contain important
information. Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

The command line instructions provided here are for csh. They may vary
depending on the particular shell you are using.  


Unloading the Distribution

If you received this distribution on physical media (CD)
rather than electronically, the distribution  should include appropriate
instructions in hardcopy form. The hardcopy information pertains to your
particular distribution format.

The instructions in this document can be used for unloading from
electronic distribution.

Distribution Format

The distribution consists of a single gzip'd tar file. This file contains
the source code, test code, and documentation of Motif.

To unpack the distribution, create a directory to hold all of the sources
and untar everything into that directory:

      % mkdir $MOTIFSOURCEDIR
      % cd $MOTIFSOURCEDIR

and then either

      % tar zxf tar-file-name

or
      % gzip -dc tar-file-name| tar xf -


where $MOTIFSOURCEDIR designates the master source directory.  If you
unpack the distribution, you will have the following subdirectory under
$MOTIFSOURCEDIR:

      motif

Note that directory permissions stored in the tar file are generally
set world writable. Make sure your umask is set the way you want before
unpacking the distribution.

Disk Space Requirements

Approximately 70MB of disk space are required to unpack the Motif distribution.
Disk usage is as follows (all amounts are in MB):

      motif         19
      motif/tests   39
      motif/doc     13


Building Motif

This section provides a generic description of the build process for Motif.
Motif has been built on the following platforms:
      Digital  AlphaStation 200   Digital UNIX V4.0
      Fujitsu  DS/90 7000         UXP/DS V20L10
      HP       HP9000/7xx         HP-UX 10.20
      IBM      RS/6000            AIX 4.2
      Novell   Intel 486/Pentium  UnixWare 2.02
      SGI      Indigo 2           Irix 6.2
      Sun      SPARCstation       Solaris 2.4
      Linux    Intel              Redhat6.0/6.1


To build Motif, you must have an ANSI C compiler installed on your system
and available in your $PATH. You should not have /usr/ucb in your $PATH,
or the build is likely to fail.

If you expect to build the distribution on more than one machine using
a shared source tree, or you just want to keep the binaries out of
the source tree, you may want to use the X11 program lndir to create a
symbolic link tree on each build machine. The links require additional
disk space but take less disk space than multiple copies of the source
tree.

Create a build directory that is not a subdirectory of the Motif master
source directory, for example:

      % mkdir $MOTIFBUILDDIR

Create a symbolic link tree using the following command:
      % lndir $MOTIFSOURCEDIR $MOTIFBUILDDIR

where $MOTIFSOURCEDIR is the Motif master source directory. Note that
the directory containing the lndir program must be in your $PATH.
Note that the builds described below must be done in the order given:

Building Motif

1. Customize $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/config/cf/site.def to reflect local
preferences for install locations, compilers, paths, etc. Note that
the default install location is /usr/dt, and is probably not the one
you want. You should change it to where you want Motif to be installed,
probably /usr.


2.  If you are building with imports (the default setup in site.def),
construct the necessary links as follows:

              % cd $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif
              % mkdir -p imports/x11
              % cd imports/x11
              % ln -s <X11_bin_directory> bin
              % ln -s <X11_includes_directory> include
              % ln -s <X11_libs_directory> lib

3. Set your current directory as follows:

        % cd $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif

4. See if there is a BootstrapCFlags mentioned in the
comments in the <vendor>.cf file. This file is in the directory
$MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/config/cf. If there isn't a definition for
BootstrapCFlags, type:

        % make World >& world.log

If there is a BootstrapCFlags definition, take its value and type:
        % make World BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="value" >& world.log

Installing Motif

Before installing Motif, check to see if you already have an installed
version of Motif. If so and you want a completely new installation
(which is recommended), then rename it or back it up and then remove it.

Installing Motif
To install motif do the following as root:

      % cd $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif
      % make install >& install.log


Documentation
The Motif guides have been provided in postscript.
These are located in the directory $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/doc/ps. With this
release, the Motif and CDE style guides have been combined and reworked
into three new volumes: Motif and CDE Style Guide, Motif and CDE Style
Guide Reference, and Motif and CDE Style Guide Certification Checklist.

The documentation consists of:

mot-pg/		Motif Programmer's Guide
mot-ref/	Motif Programmer's Reference
mot-mcsg.ps.Z	Motif and CDE Style Guide
mot-cdesgr.ps.Z	Motif and CDE Style Guide Reference
mot-csgcc.ps.Z	Motif and CDE Style Guide Certification Checklist
mot-wwg.ps.Z	Motif Widget Writer's Guide
mot-ug/		Motif User's Guide
mot-gloss.ps.Z	Motif Glossary

Manual pages in man format are provided.
These are located in the directory $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/doc/man.


Building the Motif QATS Tests

Most of the information required to build and run the Motif/QATS can be
found in the following files:

      $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/tests/doc/Output/draft/ps/chap1
      $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/tests/doc/Output/draft/ps/chap2
      $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/tests/doc/Output/draft/ps/chap3
      $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/tests/doc/Output/draft/ps/chap4
      $MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/tests/environment/README



Installing Tests

Test execution is fully functional inside the tests directory
structure. No installation is required.


Running Tests

The QATS must be run on a display controlled by a Motif 2.x version
of mwm (not dtwm). A suitable version of mwm is built in the
$MOTIFBUILDDIR/motif/clients/mwm directory.

Test Execution Results

The Motif/QATS automated tests and Motif window manager were built as
described in an earlier section.  Automated tests were built and run
on all reference platforms. Sun, HP, and SGI displays were used for
displaying tests. Motif window managers built on different platforms
were used to manage the windows while running the tests. The complete
QATS is executed on Sun, HPUX, and SGI platforms while only the new
tests or suites were executed on the remaining reference platforms.

Missing Keys WARNINGS

The keys on the keyboards used on the HP and Sun platforms are
insufficient for the needs of the tests (keys missing from the keyboard
that were expected to be mapped for the tests), causing "AUTOWARNING"
errors in every one of the tests. The standard report generation scripts
detect these benign errors and flag the entire test as an error. Since
these were not considered to be fatal errors (after inspection of the
test code), the analysis scripts filtered out AUTOWARNING errors that
came from missing keys at the very beginning of a test run.

New Test Clients
Several new test clients were added to the QATS during this release,
some automated and some manual. Test clients were added to the following
directories:

      tests/Toolkit/Buttons
      tests/uil/widgets

Golden data was generated where necessary.

Golden Data Generation

Some new QATS test suites, which do not have any previous recordings,
were run in record mode to generate golden data. The recordings were
added to this release. These new automated test suites are:

      tests/Toolkit/ComboBox
      tests/Toolkit/SpinBox
      tests/Toolkit/Notebook
      tests/Toolkit/IconVC


Test Results

The results were compared with the recordings made against Motif 2.0. The
results are mostly consistent with the previous runs carried out at
OSF. There are failures due to both QATS problems and Motif defects. All
the errors/failures reported during the run are due to known problems
in both QATS and Motif code and have defects already opened against
them. Also, the results were consistent across all the platforms on
which the tests were executed.


Compatibility

Compatibility with CDE/Motif 1.2 was given great emphasis in this release,
even at the expense of compatibility with OSF/Motif 2.0. Some OSF/Motif
2.0 applications may experience problems because of the following changes:

*The XmCSText widget has been withdrawn, as have those APIs added to
OSF/Motif 2.0 solely to support it.

*Mrm support for word-size independent .uid files has been
removed. Existing .uid files compiled with Motif 2.0 uil may not be
readable. As in OSF/Motif 1.2, .uid files are portable only between
machines with the same word size.

*New XmComboBox XmNpositionMode and XmSpinBox XmNpositionType resources
default to incompatible index values, and should be forced by all
applications using these widgets. XmONE_BASED is recommended for
XmComboBox widgets because it lets applications distinguish between new
values entered in the text field and the first item in the list.

*XmStringCreateLocalized() now handles new lines and tabs.  *The
_XmStrings array has, on some machines, been split into multiple
sub-arrays with the same techniques used by libXt. This preserves
compatibility with Motif 1.2 and permits future expansion.

*Labels for automatically created sub-widgets (like the buttons in a
File Selection Box) are now unconditionally localized, and may not be
set or overridden by the user.

*The XmDisplay XmNenableThinThickness resource now has wider effect than
it did in Motif 2.0.

*The XmDisplay XmNenableToggleVisual resource now changes the way
XmNindicatorOn and XmNindicatorType values are rendered, instead of
simply changing their default values.  Motif 2.0 applications that called
XtSetValues for these resources may notice a change. New constants have
been added to obtain the old behavior.

*In Motif 2.0 there were two distinct XmREPLACE constants, with different
values. The XmMergeMode constant has been renamed XmMERGE_REPLACE. This
is a source compatibility issue; binary compatibility is unaffected.

*XmDisplay XmNdragReceiverProtocolStyle default value has been reverted
to XmDRAG_PREFER_PREREGISTER. Users may find that XmDRAG_PREFER_DYNAMIC
is more efficient.

*The XmNenableEtchedInMenu resource causes buttons and toggles in menus
to be rendered with colors different from those in earlier releases.

*XmScrolledList and XmScrolledText scrollbar colors are computed
differently. They are now derived from the scrolled window's background
color, not the color of the XmList or XmText widget.

*To promote convergence with dtwm, mwm's panning and virtual screen
support has been removed, as has mwm's support for workspaces.

*The XmCxx library of C++ wrappers has been moved to the demos/lib
directory.


New Functionality

The following paragraphs summarize the new functionality of this release
relative to Motif 2.0.  Please refer to the specific on-line documentation
for more detailed information.

Printing

Starting with this release, Motif includes support for printing using
an X protocol based print server. This print server produces output in
three formats: PCL, Postscript and Raster.

Thread-Safe Libraries

Xm and Mrm are thread-safe enabled. This means that the libraries
themselves are thread safe and a multithreaded application need not do
explicit locking when accessing these libraries.  This is supported only
for platforms that support multithreaded programming.


Internationalization

There are several new features that support the internationalization of
Motif and developing applications for international markets. Motif now
supports the On-The-Spot input method for Text widget. Vertical Writing
is also supported.


Open/Closed Defect Lists

Two files listing defect reports are provided in the directories
$MOTIFSOURCEDIR/motif: 


OPENBUGS

Lists the currently known unresolved defects reported against Motif components.

CLOSEDBUGS

Lists the defects that have been resolved since Motif 2.0.


X11R6.4
This release has been built and tested upon a base of X11R6.4 patchlevel 3.


   Changes to X11R6.4:

	CDE and Motif 2.1.30 have been built and tested upon a base of 
	X11R6.4 patchlevel 3.  During the development of 2.1.20, a 
	significant defect in the I18N code of X was discovered; if you have
	not yet corrected this problem, you are advised to do so prior
	to making use of 2.1.30.

	The symptom is that when XMODIFIERS is not set, there is a possibility
	of memory corruption.   It is recommended that the following patch 
	be applied:
