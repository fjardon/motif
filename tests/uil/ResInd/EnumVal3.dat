#) Enumerated Values Test 3:
!)	 The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct
	 usage of enumeration values. (Note: this explanation text
	 itself tests the following:
	 - XmNeditMode = XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT
#) Bulletin Board characteristics:
!)	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
	 - XmNbackground =  sky_blue
	 - XmNmarginWidth =  20
	 - XmNmarginHeight =  20
	 - XmNdefaultPosition =  false
	 - XmNnoResize =  true
	 - XmNResizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
	 - XmNshadowType = XmSHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
	 - XmNshadowThickness = 10
#) RowColumn characteristics:
!)	 - XmNunitType = XmPIXELS
	 - XmNx = 30
	 - XmNy = 30
	 - XmNborderWidth = 2
	 - XmNrowColumnType = XmMENU_BAR
	 - XmNisHomogeneous = false
	 - XmNpacking = XmPACK_NONE
	 - XmNnumColumns = 2
	 - XmNorientation = XmVERTICAL
	 - XmNmarginHeight = 10
	 - XmNmarginWidth = 10
	 - Contains three cascade buttons (with no menus) which should
	   appear staggered in the order 3 - 2 - 1. Buttons 2 and 1
	   will overlap the border of the RowColumn
