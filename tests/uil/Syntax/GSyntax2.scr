# HISTORY



# The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct handling of gadget
# specification syntax. 
# The bulletin board contains two of each supported gadget. 
# The module header for this test specifies the gadget variant for each 
# object supporting a gadget variant. Thus the gadget in the left 
# column was specified with Xm<type> syntax. The gadget in 
# the right column was specified with Xm<type>Gadget syntax. 
# The CascadeButton gadgets are contained in a MenuBar. 
# A Message stating that the callback reason for 
# MrmNcreateCallback is 43 should be printed in the 
# term window.
