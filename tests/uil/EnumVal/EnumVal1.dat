#) Enumerated Values Test 1:
   The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct
   usage of enumeration values. (Note: this explanation text
   itself tests the following:
!)		 - XmNeditMode = XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT
#) Bulletin Board characteristics:
!)		 - XmNborderWidth = 1
		 - XmNbackground =  sky_blue
		 - XmNmarginWidth =  20
		 - XmNmarginHeight =  20
		 - XmNdefaultPosition =  false
		 - XmNnoResize =  true
		 - XmNResizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
		 - XmNshadowType = XmSHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
		 - XmNshadowThickness = 10
#) ScrolledList characteristics:
!)		 - XmNwidth = 200
		 - XmNheight = 80
		 - XmNshadowThickness = 4
		 - XmNitems = string_table...
		 - XmNvisibleItemCount = 7 (*)
		 - XmNselectionPolicy = XmMULTIPLE_SELECT
		 - XmNlistSizePolicy = XmCONSTANT
		 - XmNscrollBarDisplayPolicy = XmAS_NEEDED
		 - XmNscrollBarPlacement = XmTOP_LEFT
		 (*) visibleItemCount has lower priority than height
