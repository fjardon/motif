# HISTORY

# @) StringExt tests the XmString functions which get dimension information 
# for displaying XmStrings. The values returned from the XmString functions
# are compared against the values returned from the function XTextExtent().

# #) A blank drawing area widget should be displayed.
# #) Click MB1 in the drawing area widget. The strings \"X is an Example of Z\"
# and \"Z is an Example of X\" should now be displayed in the drawing area widget.

# A rectangle is drawn around each string where the dimensions of the rectangle
# are the dimensions returned from XmStringExtent(). Verify that the rectangles
# represent the smallest bounding box which encloses each string.
# #) Tables have been printed to stdout which list the functions called
# and the dimensions returned from each function for the given string. 
# A message will then be printed indicating whether each XmString function
# passed or failed. If your term window is small, you may need to scroll
# in order to see all the text.
