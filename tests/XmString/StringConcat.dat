@) Running XmStringConcat.

#) This test calls XmStringConcatAndFree() with every combination
   of two XmStringComponentTypes together.
   Messages will be printed to the terminal indicating the pair 
   of XmStringComponentTypes being passed to XmStringConcatAndFree()
   and whether the return of a new XmString was successful.
   Check that each combination passes.
