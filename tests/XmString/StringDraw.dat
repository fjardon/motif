#) This is the StringDraw test to test XmStringDraw.

#) You should see a BulletinBoard containing an empty DrawingArea 
   widget of size 300x200.

C)

#) There should be four lines showing the same string 
   "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING", in font "9x15bold" (or "fixed" if 
   "9x15bold" is not available), with different levels of 
   clipping taking place.

#) Line 1 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" complete.

#) Line 2 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" with some
   horizontal clipping, meaning, some of the characters should be
   clipped off.

#) Line 3 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" complete
   in the horizontal direction, but with characters getting clipped
   in height.

#) Line 4 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" with
   both horizontal and vertical clipping.

E)
