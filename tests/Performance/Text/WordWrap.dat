The following text is used to test the performance of wordWrap in the worse case scenario when there are no newlines embedded in the text. The only newlines will be though added for the purposes of starting a new paragraph. So here we go.........
Internationalization is a method of application development that allows the application to be run in many different languages without having to be rewritten or recompiled. There are several important
issues to keep in mind when designing an application so that it takes advantage of Motif's internationalization capabilities.
An internationalized application contains no code that is dependent on the user's language, the characters needed to represent the language, or any formats ( such as date and currency ) that the 
user expects to see and interact with.  Motif accomplishes this by storing language and custom dependent information outside the application.
Because the language and culture dependent information is separate form the application source code, the application does not need to be rewritten or recompiled to be marketed in different countries.
Instead the only requirement is for the external information to be localized to accommodate the local language and custom.
Localizing the application includes the process of translating certain parts of the external information into the appropriate language and storing the translated information in files that are then
accessed by the application. In addition, the application may be told the format to use to display time, date and the other language or culture dependent formats shown in the previous figure.
Every language consists of a set of characters that, either individually or in combination, represents meaningful words or concepts in the language. The set of characters is called a character set.
The set of binary values needed to represent all the characters in a language is called a coded character set or, more simply, a code set.
Several attempts were started long ago to standardize character sets and continue to this day. The most commonly used code set for English is the American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).
It originally used a 7-bit encoding scheme plus an eighth bit for error control. Using 7 bits for character representation allows 128 unique binary values. Later versions use the eighth bit as a code bit allowing 255 characters. Both are fine for English and some other alphabetic languages, but neither is suitable for ideographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Ideographic languages represent a concept or an idea as a single character; consequently, there are thousands of characters in these languages, and two or more bytes are needed to represent the characters.

It originally used a 7-bit encoding scheme plus an eighth bit for error control. Using 7 bits for character representation allows 128 unique binary values. Later versions use the eighth bit as a code bit allowing 255 characters. Both are fine for English and some other alphabetic languages, but neither is suitable for ideographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Ideographic languages represent a concept or an idea as a single character; consequently, there are thousands of characters in these languages, and two or more bytes are needed to represent the characters.

The following text is used to test the performance of wordWrap in the worse case scenario when there are no newlines embedded in the text. The only newlines will be though added for the purposes of starting a new paragraph. So here we go.........
Internationalization is a method of application development that allows the application to be run in many different languages without having to be rewritten or recompiled. There are several important issues to keep in mind when designing an application so that it takes advantage of Motif's internationalization capabilities.
An internationalized application contains no code that is dependent on the user's language, the characters needed to represent the language, or any formats ( such as date and currency ) that the user expects to see and interact with.  Motif accomplishes this by storing language and custom dependent information outside the application.
Because the language and culture dependent information is separate form the application source code, the application does not need to be rewritten or recompiled to be marketed in different countries. Instead the only requirement is for the external information to be localized to accommodate the local language and custom.
Localizing the application includes the process of translating certain parts of the external information into the appropriate language and storing the translated information in files that are then accessed by the application. In addition, the application may be told the format to use to display time, date and the other language or culture dependent formats shown in the previous figure.
Every language consists of a set of characters that, either individually or in combination, represents meaningful words or concepts in the language. The set of characters is called a character set. The set of binary values needed to represent all the characters in a language is called a coded character set or, more simply, a code set.

Internationalization is a method of application development that allows the application to be run in many different languages without having to be rewritten or recompiled. There are several important issues to keep in mind when designing an application so that it takes advantage of Motif's internationalization capabilities.
An internationalized application contains no code that is dependent on the user's language, the characters needed to represent the language, or any formats ( such as date and currency ) that the user expects to see and interact with.  Motif accomplishes this by storing language and custom dependent information outside the application.
Because the language and culture dependent information is separate form the application source code, the application does not need to be rewritten or recompiled to be marketed in different countries. Instead the only requirement is for the external information to be localized to accommodate the local language and custom.
Localizing the application includes the process of translating certain parts of the external information into the appropriate language and storing the translated information in files that are then accessed by the application. In addition, the application may be told the format to use to display time, date and the other language or culture dependent formats shown in the previous figure.
Every language consists of a set of characters that, either individually or in combination, represents meaningful words or concepts in the language. The set of characters is called a character set. The set of binary values needed to represent all the characters in a language is called a coded character set or, more simply, a code set.
Several attempts were started long ago to standardize character sets and continue to this day. The most commonly used code set for English is the American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). It originally used a 7-bit encoding scheme plus an eighth bit for error control. Using 7 bits for character representation allows 128 unique binary values. Later versions use the eighth bit as a code bit allowing 255 characters. Both are fine for English and some other alphabetic languages, but neither is suitable for ideographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Ideographic languages represent a concept or an idea as a single character; consequently, there are thousands of characters in these languages, and two or more bytes are needed to represent the characters.

An internationalized application contains no code that is dependent on the user's language, the characters needed to represent the language, or any formats ( such as date and currency ) that the user expects to see and interact with.  Motif accomplishes this by storing language and custom dependent information outside the application.
Because the language and culture dependent information is separate form the application source code, the application does not need to be rewritten or recompiled to be marketed in different countries. Instead the only requirement is for the external information to be localized to accommodate the local language and custom.
Localizing the application includes the process of translating certain parts of the external information into the appropriate language and storing the translated information in files that are then accessed by the application. In addition, the application may be told the format to use to display time, date and the other language or culture dependent formats shown in the previous figure.
Every language consists of a set of characters that, either individually or in combination, represents meaningful words or concepts in the language. The set of characters is called a character set. The set of binary values needed to represent all the characters in a language is called a coded character set or, more simply, a code set.
Several attempts were started long ago to standardize character sets and continue to this day. The most commonly used code set for English is the American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). It originally used a 7-bit encoding scheme plus an eighth bit for error control. Using 7 bits for character representation allows 128 unique binary values. Later versions use the eighth bit as a code bit allowing 255 characters. Both are fine for English and some other alphabetic languages, but neither is suitable for ideographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Ideographic languages represent a concept or an idea as a single character; consequently, there are thousands of characters in these languages, and two or more bytes are needed to represent the characters.

The following text is used to test the performance of wordWrap in the worse case scenario when there are no newlines embedded in the text. The only newlines will be though added for the purposes of starting a new paragraph. So here we go.........

Localizing the application includes the process of translating certain parts of the external information into the appropriate language and storing the translated information in files that are then accessed by the application. In addition, the application may be told the format to use to display time, date and the other language or culture dependent formats shown in the previous figure.
Every language consists of a set of characters that, either individually or in combination, represents meaningful words or concepts in the language. The set of characters is called a character set. The set of binary values needed to represent all the characters in a language is called a coded character set or, more simply, a code set.
Several attempts were started long ago to standardize character sets and continue to this day. The most commonly used code set for English is the American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). It originally used a 7-bit encoding scheme plus an eighth bit for error control. Using 7 bits for character representation allows 128 unique binary values. Later versions use the eighth bit as a code bit allowing 255 characters. Both are fine for English and some other alphabetic languages, but neither is suitable for ideographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Ideographic languages represent a concept or an idea as a single character; consequently, there are thousands of characters in these languages, and two or more bytes are needed to represent the characters.

The following text is used to test the performance of wordWrap in the worse case scenario when there are no newlines embedded in the text. The only newlines will be though added for the purposes of starting a new paragraph. So here we go.........
Internationalization is a method of application development that allows the application to be run in many different languages without having to be rewritten or recompiled. There are several important issues to keep in mind when designing an application so that it takes advantage of Motif's internationalization capabilities.
An internationalized application contains no code that is dependent on the user's language, the characters needed to represent the language, or any formats ( such as date and currency ) that the user expects to see and interact with.  Motif accomplishes this by storing language and custom dependent information outside the application.
