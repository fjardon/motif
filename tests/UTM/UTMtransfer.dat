#) This is the UTMtransfer test.
#) You must see a UTMtransfer window on your screen and a UTMPrim1 window.
#) If you don't see an UTMPrim1 window, please run:
!)
              "UTMPrim1 -u -n&"

C)

#) The following panels test the transfer of the primary selection.
#) When you select an object with a primary selection, and then transfer it 
   (copying it) in an other widget, the following actions should occur:
!)
          1. The convertCallback of the widget owning the primary 
             selection is called multiple times with the selection 
             field set to PRIMARY and different conversion target 
             that this widget supports as a source of data.

          2. The destinationCallback of the widget receiving 
             the transfer is called with the selection field 
             set to PRIMARY and the operation field set to XmCOPY.

#) In our test, the destination widget is the drawing area (red square) in the 
   UTMtransfer window.
C)

#) Select the "Amazing" word in the TextField widget of the UTMPrim1 window.
#) Pulldown the "Edit" menu of the UTMtransfer window and select 
   "Paste (copy)".
#) The list of targets supported by the TextField widget appears in the list
   of the UTMtransfer window.

#) You should see in your term window the calls to the TextField 
   convertCallback, and the call to the drawing area destinationCallback.
#) You can play in the UTMtransfer window, by selecting a target type in the 
   list. When selected, the "Target" name, "Target Value" and target "Type" 
   are updated in the "Target Values" panel.
C)

#) Select the "scream" word in the Text widget of the UTMPrim1 window.
#) As the primary selection change, you will notice in your term window, 
   2 TextField widget convertCallback calls, because this widget just lost
   the focus and the primary selection:
!)
          XmNconvertCallback called for TextField widget.
                  selection         = _MOTIF_DESTINATION
                  conversion target = _MOTIF_LOSE_SELECTION

          XmNconvertCallback called for TextField widget.
                  selection         = PRIMARY
                  conversion target = _MOTIF_LOSE_SELECTION

#) Pulldown the "Edit" menu of the UTMtransfer window and select 
   "Paste (copy)".
#) The list of targets supported by the Text widget appears in the list
   of the UTMtransfer window.

#) The following panels test the transfer (move) of the primary selection.
#) When you select an object with a primary selection, and then transfer it 
   (moving it) to an other widget, the following actions should occur:

             a source of data.

          2. The destinationCallback of the widget receiving 
             the transfer is called with the selection field 
             set to PRIMARY and the operation field set to XmMOVE.

          3. When the transfer is completed, a delete request 
             is sent to the owner of the primary selection. 
             That is the convertCallback is called with the 
             selection field set to PRIMARY and the conversion 
             target set to DELETE.
