#) This is the DNDDrop1 test.

#) If you want to test CR4924 about unitType and dragUnder highlighting,
   rerun the test with "DNDDrop1 -u showunitbug".

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard. If you are running the test
   with "-u showunitbug", the Text widget is created with a
   unitType of 100TH_MILLIMETERS and highlightThickness of 400,
   and resides within a Frame.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as
   dropSites.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.

#) There should be a control panel containing four optionMenus
   for modifying animationStyle, dropActivity, dropSiteOperations,
   and dragOperations. The control panel should also show an 
   \"Apply To\", for applying the changes in
   animationStyle, dropActivity, and dropSiteOperations, to one or more
   of the registered dropsites.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\" and \"Inactive\". \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", \"All\" and \"None\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\" and \"None\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Apply To\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"PushBtn0\", \"PushBtn1\", \"PushBtn4\", and \"All\". \"All\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns. A dragIcon should 
   appear consisting of a runner, an open folder, and an arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget.

#) When the pointer is moving within PuishBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   you should not see any visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0, PushBtn2, or PushBtn4,
   the borders of those PushBtns should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted. If you are running the
   test with "-u showunitbug", you should see a highlightThickness
   of about 4 millmeters. If instead, you see that almost the whole
   Text widget gets filled with the highlight color, then CR4924 (about
   DND code not using unitType other than PIXELS) has not been fixed.

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard but outside of
   all the PushBtns and the Text widget, there should be no visual 
   change.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon shoudl snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"ShadowIn\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   all the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.
   
#) Now, when the pointer is being dragged over PushBtn0, PushBtn2,
   and PushBtn4, the dragUnder effect should be displayed by an 
   inset shadow.

#) When the pointer is being dragged over other PushBtns or the
   BulletinBoard outside of all the PushBtns and Text widget, there
   should be no visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon shoudl snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"ShadowOut\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   all the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.
   
#) Now, when the pointer is being dragged over PushBtn0, PushBtn2,
   and PushBtn4, the dragUnder effect should be displayed by an 
   outset shadow.

#) When the pointer is being dragged over other PushBtns or the
   BulletinBoard outside of all the PushBtns and Text widget, there
   should be no visual change. Since the button shadows are already shadow 
   out, there should be no visual difference from when the pointer was
   being moved over the registered dropSites (PushBtn0, PushBtn2, PushBtn4).

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon should snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"None\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   all the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.

#) Now, when the pointer is being dragged over any of the PushBtns 
   (including PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4), or the 
   BulletinBoard outside of all the PushBtns and Text widget, there
   should be no visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon shoudl snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

#) Select \"HighLight\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

C)


#) Select \"Inactive\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.

#) Now, even when the pointer is being dragged over PushBtn0, 
   PushBtn2, or PushBtn4, there should be no visual change. And also, 
   if you attempt drop on any of these three registered dropSites
   by releasing BTransfer with the pointer over any one of them,
   the dragIcon should zap back to the place of drag initiation
   and disappear.

#) Select \"Active\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and select
   \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.

#) Now, the visual changes should be back while dragging over
   PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4. And also, if you attempt
   drop over any one of these dropSites, the dragIcon should
   melt into the background and disappear.


#) Select \"Ignore\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and select
   \"PushBtn0\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new animationStyle to 
   PushBtn0.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.

#) Drag over PushBtn2. While dragging, the drag under visuals for PushBtn2
   should not be clipped by PushBnt0, i.e, the highlight for the entire
   PushButton should be visible.  Attempt a drop over PushBtn0. The
   dragIcon should snap back to the place of drag initiation and disappear.

C)


#) Now, let us try different combinations of \"Drop Operations\" 
   and \"Drag Operations\". We will be testing here the resultant
   operation due to different combinations of dragOperations and
   dropSiteOperations.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to Move and Copy.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to
   set the dropSiteOperations to Move and Copy. Select \"All\" from the 
   \"Apply To\" menu to to apply this new dropSiteOperations to all
   the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.
   The operationIcon part of the dragIcon should indicate Move
   operation (single folder is the default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0. The borders of
   PushBtn0 should get highlighted.

#) With the dragIcon over PushBtn0, release BTransfer to attempt
   a drop. The dragIcon should melt into the background of 
   PushBtn0, indicating the drop was successful.

#) Repeat steps 4 through 6 only replacing PushBtn0 by PushBtn2
   and PushBtn4. In both the cases, you should see an indication
   of a successful drop.

#) Initiate Drag with the pointer positioned on any of the
   PushBtns and drag over to the Text widget. Attempt a drop
   onto the Text widget by releasing BTransfer with the dragIcon
   over the Text widget. The dragIcon should melt into the
   background of the Text widget indicating a successful drop.
   Also, you should see the text "return value" inserted into
   the Text widget.

C)



#) Select \"MoveOnly\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to only Move.

#) Select \"CopyOnly\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to
   set the dropSiteOperations to only Copy. Select \"All\" from the
   \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new dropSiteOperations to all
   the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtns1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5, and 
   start dragging.  The operationIcon part of the dragIcon 
   should indicate Move operation (single folder is the default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0. The operation
   icon should disappear, indicating there is no common operation
   possible between the dragSource and the dropSite.

#) With the dragIcon on PushBtn0, attempt a drop by releasing
   BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to the PushBtn from
   where the drag was initiated, indicating the drop was a
   failure.

#) Select \"CopyOnly\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to only Copy.

#) Select \"MoveOnly\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to
   set the dropSiteOperations to only Move. 
   Select \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites.


#) Repeat steps 3 through 5. The operationIcon part of the dragIcon 
   should indicate Copy operation (double folder is the default).

#) With both the combinations of dropOperations and dragOperations
   described above, initiate drag from one of the PushBtns, and
   attempt a drop on the Text widget. In both the cases, the
   drop on the Text widget should succeed, i.e., the dragIcon
   should melt into the background of the Text widget, and you
   should see the text "return value" inserted into the Text
   widget.

C)

#) Select \"None\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to set the
   dragOperations None.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to
   set the dropSiteOperations to Move and Copy. 
   Select \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites.


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer with the pointer on
   PushBtn1 and dragging. You should see a dragIcon with no
   operation icon.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0, PushBtn2, or
   PushBtn4. You should not see any dragUnder effect. Drag it 
   the Text widget. You should not see any dragUnder effect.

#) With dragIcon on PushBt0, attempt a drop by releasing 
   BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to PushBtn1,
   indicating a drop failure.

#) Initiate Drag from PushBtn1 and drag over to the Text widget.
   The text widget should not get highlighted. Attempt a drop
   onto the Text widget by releasing BTransfer. The dragIcon
   should snap back to PushBtn1 indicating a drop failure.

C)


#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to Move and Copy.

#) Select \"None\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to set the
   dropSiteOperations to None. 
   Select \"All\" from the \"Apply To\" menu to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites.  


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtns1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5, and 
   start dragging.  The operationIcon part of the dragIcon 
   should indicate Move operation (single folder is the default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0. The operation
   icon should disappear, indicating there is no common operation
   possible between the dragSource and the dropSite.

#) With the dragIcon on PushBtn0, attempt a drop by releasing
   BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to the PushBtn from
   where the drag was initiated, indicating the drop was a
   failure.

#) Initiate Drag from PushBtn1 and drag over to the Text widget.
   The text widget should get highlighted. Attempt a drop
   onto the Text widget by releasing BTransfer. The drop
   on the Text widget should succeed, i.e., the dragIcon
   should melt into the background of the Text widget, and you
   should see the text "return value" inserted into the Text
   widget.


C)


#) Select \"Move_n_Link\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to Move and Link.

#) Select \"LinkOnly\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to set the
   dropSiteOperations to LinkOnly. 
   Click on \"ApplyChanges\" to apply this new dropSiteOperations to all 
   the registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5, and 
   start dragging.  The operationIcon part of the dragIcon 
   should indicate Move operation (single folder is the default).

#) With the drag in progress, press and hold down <Shift> AND <Ctrl>
   keys. The operationIcon part of the dragIcon should change
   to indicate Link operation.

#) Release <Shift> AND <Ctrl> keys. The operationIcon part of the
   dragIcon should revert back to indicating Move operation.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0. The operation
   icon should change to show Link, indicating Link is the possible
   operation between the dragSource and the dropSite.

#) With the dragIcon on PushBtn0, attempt a drop by releasing
   BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to the PushBtn from
   where the drag was initiated, indicating the drop was a
   failure. Also, you should see a message in the term window
   saying "Link Operation currently not supported".


C)

#) The Text widget and PushBtn0 have been unmanaged. This is to 
   test CR5215. 

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu to
   set the dragOperations to Move and Copy.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu to
