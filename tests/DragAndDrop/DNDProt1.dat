#) This is the DNDProt1 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as
   dropSites.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.

#) There should be a control panel containing four optionMenus
   for modifying animationStyle, dropActivity, dropSiteOperations,
   and dragOperations. The control panel should also show a 
   PushButton \"ApplyChanges\" for applying the changes in
   animationStyle, dropActivity, and dropSiteOperations, to the 
   registered dropSites.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\" and \"Inactive\". \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) Run the test "DNDDrop1 -u -noinstruct". Move \"topLevel0\" and
   the control panel of "DNDDrop1" so that the topLevel windows
   and the control panels of both the tests are completely
   visible.

C)


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns in the \"topLevel0\"
   of "DNDProt1". A dragIcon should appear consisting of a runner,
   an open folder, and an arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget in the \"topLevel0\" of "DNDDrop1".

#) When the pointer is moving within PuishBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", you should not see any visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0, PushBtn2, or PushBtn4,
   of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", the borders of those PushBtns should 
   get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget of \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDDrop1", the borders of the Text widget should get highlighted.  

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard of \"topLevel0\", 
   "DNDDrop1", but outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget, there
   should be no visual change.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon shoudl snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

#) Select \"ShadowIn\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu in "DNDDrop1"
   and click on \"All\" to apply this new animationStyle to
   all the registered PushBtn dropSites of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns in the \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDProt1", and start dragging.
   
#) Now, when the pointer is being dragged over PushBtn0, PushBtn2,
   and PushBtn4, of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", the dragUnder effect 
   should be displayed by an inset shadow.

#) When the pointer is being dragged over other PushBtns or the
   BulletinBoard outside of all the PushBtns and Text widget, of 
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", there should be no visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, of \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDDrop1", the borders of the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon should snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

   And also, if you attempt drop over any one of these dropSites, the
   dragIcon should melt into the background and disappear.

C)


#) Now, let us try different combinations of \"Drop Operations\" 
   and \"Drag Operations\". We will be testing here the resultant
   operation due to different combinations of dragOperations and
   dropSiteOperations.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu of
   "DNDProt1" to set the dragOperations to Move and Copy.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu of
   "DNDDrop1" to set the dropSiteOperations to Move and Copy. Click 
   on \"All\" of "DNDDrop1" to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns in the \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDProt1", and start dragging. The operationIcon part of the 
   dragIcon should indicate Move operation (single folder is the 
   default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0 of \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDDrop1". The borders of that PushBtn0 should get highlighted.

#) With the dragIcon over PushBtn0 of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", 
   release BTransfer to attempt a drop. The dragIcon should melt 
   into the background of PushBtn0, indicating the drop was 
   successful.

#) Repeat steps 4 through 6 only replacing PushBtn0 by PushBtn2
   and PushBtn4. In both the cases, you should see an indication
   of a successful drop.

#) Initiate Drag with the pointer positioned on any of the
   PushBtns of \"topLevel0\", "DNDProt1", and drag over to the Text 
   widget of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1". Attempt a drop onto that 
   Text widget by releasing BTransfer with the dragIcon over that 
   Text widget. The dragIcon should melt into the background of that
   Text widget indicating a successful drop.  Also, you should see 
   the text "return value" inserted into that Text widget.

C)



#) Select \"MoveOnly\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu of
   "DNDProt1" to set the dragOperations to only Move.

#) Select \"CopyOnly\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu of
   "DNDDrop1" to set the dropSiteOperations to only Copy. Click 
   on \"All\" of "DNDDrop1" to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns in the \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDProt1", and start dragging. The operationIcon part of the 
   dragIcon should indicate Move operation (single folder is the
   default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0 of \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDDrop1". The operation icon should disappear, indicating 
   there is no common operation possible between the dragSource 
   and the dropSite.

#) With the dragIcon on PushBtn0 of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", attempt
   a drop by releasing BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to 
   the PushBtn from where the drag was initiated, indicating the drop 
   was a failure.

#) Select \"CopyOnly\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu of
   "DNDProt1" to set the dragOperations to only Copy.

#) Select \"MoveOnly\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu of
   "DNDDrop1" to set the dropSiteOperations to only Move. Click 
   on \"ApplyChanges\" of "DNDDrop1" to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Repeat steps 3 through 5. The operationIcon part of the 
   dragIcon should indicate Copy operation (double folder is the
   default).

#) With both the combinations of dropOperations and dragOperations
   described above, initiate drag from one of the PushBtns of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDProt1", and attempt a drop on the Text widget
   of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1". In both the cases, the drop on the 
   Text widget should succeed, i.e., the dragIcon should melt into 
   the background of the Text widget, and you should see the text 
   "return value" inserted into that Text widget.

C)

#) Select \"None\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu of "DNDProt1" 
   to set the dragOperations to None.

#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu of
   "DNDDrop1" to set the dropSiteOperations to Move and Copy. Click 
   on \"ApplyChanges\" of "DNDDrop1" to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns in the \"topLevel0\",
   "DNDProt1", and start dragging. You should see a dragIcon with no
   operation icon.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0, PushBtn2, or
   PushBtn4 of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1". You should not see any 
   dragUnder effect. Drag it the Text widget of \"topLevel0\", 
   "DNDDrop1". You should not see any dragUnder effect.

#) With dragIcon on PushBt0 of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", attempt a 
   drop by releasing BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to 
   the PushBtn from where the drag was initiated, indicating a drop 
   failure.

#) Initiate Drag from any PushBtn of \"topLevel0\", "DNDProt1" and drag
   over to the Text widget of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1". The text widget
   should not get highlighted. Attempt a drop onto that Text widget 
   by releasing BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to the PushBtn 
   from where the drag was initiated, indicating a drop failure.

C)


#) Select \"Move_n_Copy\" from the  \"Drag Operations\" menu of
   "DNDProt1" to set the dragOperations to Move and Copy.

#) Select \"None\" from the  \"Drop Operations\" menu of
   "DNDDrop1" to set the dropSiteOperations to None. Click 
   on \"ApplyChanges\" of "DNDDrop1" to apply this new 
   dropSiteOperations to all the registered PushBtn dropSites of
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1".

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on  PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5 in the 
   \"topLevel0\", "DNDProt1", and start dragging. The operationIcon
   part of the dragIcon should indicate Move operation (single folder
   is the default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag over to PushBtn0of \"topLevel0\", 
   "DNDDrop1". The operation icon should disappear, indicating there 
   is no common operation possible between the dragSource and the 
   dropSite.

#) With the dragIcon on PushBtn0 \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1", attempt a 
   drop by releasing BTransfer. The dragIcon should snap back to the
   PushBtn from where the drag was initiated, indicating the drop was a
   failure.

#) Initiate Drag from PushBtn1 of \"topLevel0\", "DNDProt1", and drag
   over to the Text widget of \"topLevel0\", "DNDDrop1". The text widget
   should not get highlighted. Attempt a drop onto that Text widget by
   releasing BTransfer. The drop on that Text widget should succeed, 
   i.e., the dragIcon should melt into the background of that Text widget,
   and you should see the text "return value" inserted into that Text
   widget.
