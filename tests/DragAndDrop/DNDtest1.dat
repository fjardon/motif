#) This is the DNDtest1 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as
   dropSites.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Move the pointer to PushBtn1. 

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default). A dragIcon
   should appear consisting of a runner, two open folders, and an 
   arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, move the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   you should not see any visual change since these are not registered
   as dropSites.

#) When the pointer is moving over PushBtn2, you should not see any
   visual change. The reason for this is that, even though PushBtn2
   is registered as a dropSite, it is not registered to accept any
   drops (importTargets is NULL and numImportTargets is 0).

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0 or PushBtn4, the 
   borders of those PushBtns should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard but outside of
   all the PushBtns and the Text widget, there should be no visual 
   change.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer on the root window outside the
   topLevel window. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, and 
   disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or
   PushBtn5. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, and disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn2. The dragIcon
   should zap back to PushBtn1, and disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over the BulletinBoard, but
   outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget. The dragIcon
   should again zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn0 or PushBtn4.
   The dragIcon should melt into the background and disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over the Text widget.
   The text \"return value\" should get inserted into the Text
   widget and the dragIcon should melt into the background and 
   disappear.
