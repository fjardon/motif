#) This is the DNDIcon2 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as
   dropSites.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.

#) There should be a control panel containing twelve optionMenus
   for modifying respectively, animationStyle, dropActivity, 
   dropSiteOperations, dragOperations, blendModel,
   opIcon attachment, stateIcon attachment, cursorForeground, 
   cursorBackground, operationCursorIcon, stateCursorIcon,
   and sourceCursorIcon. The control panel should also show a 
   PushButton \"ApplyChanges\" for applying the changes in 
   animationStyle, dropActivity, and dropSiteOperations, to the 
   registered dropSites.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\" and \"Inactive\". \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", \"All\", and \"None\". 
   \"Move_n_Copy\" is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", \"All\", and \"None\". 
   \"CopyOnly\" is the selected item at startup.

C)


#) The \"Blend Model\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"All\", \"State_n_Source\", \"JustSource\", and \"None\".

#) The \"OpIcon Attchment\" and the \"StateIcon Attachment\" optionMenus
   should show the options, \"NorthWest\", \"North\", \"NorthEast\",
   \"East\", \"SouthEast\", \"South\", \"SouthWest\", \"West\" and
   \"Center\". \"SouthEast\" is the selected item at startup for the
   menu \"OpIcon Attchment\", and \"NorthEast\" is the selected item at
   startup for the menu \"StateIcon Attachment\".

#) The \"Cursor Foreground\", \"Cursor Background\", optionMenus 
   should show the options, \"Red\", \"Black\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\",
   and \"White\". \"Cursor Background\" has \"White\" as the
   selected item at startup and \"Cursor Foreground\" has \"Red\" 
   as the selected item at startup.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1. 
   
#) A dragIcon should appear consisting of three squares with white
   background and and red text in the foreground. The topleft 
   square should have \"SRC ICON\" in the middle, with \"SRC\" on
   one line and \"ICON\" on another line. The top right square
   should have \"NONE ICON\" in the middle, with \"NONE\" on one
   line and \"ICON\" on another line. And the bottom right
   square ahould have \"COPY ICON\" in the middle with \"COPY\"
   on one line and \"ICON\" on another line. All three should be
   completely visible.

#) The attachment for the operationCursorIcon (bottom right
   square) is SouthEast and for the stateCursorIcon (top right
   square) is NorthEast. The top left square is the 
   sourceCursorIcon.

#) Note that the hotspot for the dragIcon comes from the state
   Icon, which is the topleft corner of the square when the
   state is None (meaning when you are dragging over widgets
   which are not registered as dropSites).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget.

#) When the pointer is moving within PuishBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   or within the Bulletinboard but outside of all the PushBtns and
   the text widget, you should not see any visual change. The 
   dragIcon should be the same as when you initiated the drag with 
   pointer on PushBtn1, meaning, it should show that you are dragging
   over widgets that are not registered dropSites.

#) When the pointer is moving over PushBtn2, you should not see any
   visual dragUnder effect. But the stateIcon (top right square) 
   part of the dragIcon should show \"INVALID ICON\", instead of 
   \"NONE ICON\".The reason for this is that, even though PushBtn2 
   is registered as a dropSite, it is not registered to accept any 
   drops (importTargets is NULL and numImportTargets is 0).

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0 or PushBtn4, or the
   Text widget, the borders of those PushBtns or the Text widget 
   should get highlighted. Also, the stateIcon (the top right square)
   should change to \"VALID ICON\", and the hotspot should shift to 
   the left midpoint of that square.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"Inactive\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and click
   on \"ApplyChanges\" to apply this new dropActivity to all the
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1 and start dragging.
   
#) Now, except the Text widget, wherever you drag inside the 
   BulletinBoard, the stateIcon should show \"NONE ICON\",
   meaning, even the registered dropSites are treated as 
   non-dropSites when dropActivity is \"Inactive\".

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"Active\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and click
   on \"ApplyChanges\" to apply this new dropActivity to all the
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Now, initiate drag from PushBtn1, and drag over all the PushBtns.
   The stateIcon should show that the behavior is back to when
   we started, meaning, PushBtn0, PushBtn4, and the Text widget are
   Valid dropSites, PushBtn2 is an Invalid dropSite, and all other
   PushBtns and the BulletinBoard are non-dropSites.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"State_n_Source\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. The dragIcon should now consist of
   only two squares, the one on the left (sourceCursorIcon) showing
   \"SRC ICON\", and the one on the right (stateCursorIcon) showing
   \"NONE ICON\".

#) Release BTransfer with pointer over PushBtn3. The dragIcon should
   zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"JustSource\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. The dragIcon should now consist of
   only one square (sourceCursorIcon) showing \"SRC ICON\".

#) Start dragging with BTransfer pressed, on different PushBtns. Note
   the hotspot has now shifted to the topleft corner of the dragIcon.

#) Release BTransfer with pointer over PushBtn3. The dragIcon should
   zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"None\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. There should be no dragIcon visible
   now. But as you drag the pointer with BTransfer pressed, the
   state should be visible through dragUnder effect, i.e., while you
   are dragging over PushBtn0, PushBtn4, or the tet widget, you
   should see that the borders of these widgets get highlighted.

#) Release BTransfer with pointer over PushBtn3. 

#) Select \"All\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

C)


#) Select "Red" from the \"Cursor ForeGround\" menu and 
   "Yellow" from the \"Cursor Background\" menu and initiate drag. 
   You should see that all parts of the dragIcon have red foreground
   and yellow background. Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on 
   the BulletinBoard. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and 
   disappear.

#) Repeat step 1 with different color selections.

#) Select "Red" from the \"Cursor ForeGround\" menu and "White"
   from the  \"Cursor Background\" menu.

   background and and red text in the foreground. The topleft 
   square should have \"SRC ICON\" in the middle, with \"SRC\" on
   one line and \"ICON\" on another line. The top right square
   should have \"NONE ICON\" in the middle, with \"NONE\" on one
   line and \"ICON\" on another line. And the bottom right
   square ahould have \"COPY ICON\" in the middle with \"COPY\"
   on one line and \"ICON\" on another line. All three should be
   completely visible.

#) The bottom right square is the operationCursorIcon  and top right
   square is the stateCursorIcon. The top left square is the 
   sourceCursorIcon.

#) Release BTransfer with pointer over PushBtn3. The dragIcon should
   zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"NorthWest\" from the \"OpIcon Attchment\" menu.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1.
