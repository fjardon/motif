#) This is the DNDTxtLbl1 test.

#) This is just to test the DND support in the Motif Label and Text
   widget.

#) You should see a Label widget with two-line label and a multiline
   Text widget.

#) Position the pointer anywhere on the Label. Initiate drag by 
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text
   widget, position the pointer to the left of word "test" and release
   BTransfer. The text \"Two-Line\" should appear in the Text widget
   at the point where the button was released and on the next line
   the text \"Label String\" should appear. Also the portion "test string"
   of the original text should appear at the end of the second line.

C)


#) Click MouseBtn1 at the end of the second line of text and hit <Return>

#) Enter the text "Here is New Text".

#) Select the word "Here".

#) Position the pointer on the selected text and initiate drag by
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the point to the
   left of the string "Two-Line", and release BTransfer. The selected
   text "Here" should get moved from its original position on the third
   line to the point where BTransfer was released.

#) Select the word "New".

#) Position the pointer on the selected text and initiate drag by
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) Now hold \<Ctrl\> key down and with BTransfer pressed, drag the
   pointer to the beginning of second line in the Text widget and still
   holding the \<Ctrl\> key, release BTransfer. This time, the
   selected text "New" should get copied into the new location, meaning
   it should still be present at its original position also.

C)

/* Case to test CR5240 */
#) Now there should be one more label widget between the two line label
   widget and the text widget, with the label string "One line" and a
   borderWidth of 5.

#) Select the last word "Text" on the third line of the Text widget.

#) Position the pointer anywhere on the new Label with the labelString
   "One line". Initiate drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text
   widget to the left of the word "String" on the second line of the
   text widget, and release BTransfer.  The text "One line" should
   appear in the Text widget at the point where the button was released.

#) Again, Position the pointer anywhere on the new Label with the 
   labelString "One line". Initiate drag by pressing BTransfer.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text
   widget anywhere on the selected string "Text", and release
   BTransfer. The text "One line" should replace the previously
   selected text "Text".

C)

/* Case to test CR5958 */
#) Now there should be a pushbutton widget between the one line label
   widget and the text widget, with a blank label string and a
   borderWidth of 5. Initiate drag by pressing BTransfer.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text widget and 
   release BTransfer. No core dumps or segvs should occur.
