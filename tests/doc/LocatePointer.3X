.SH NAME
\*LLocatePointer \*O\(em Command to move the pointer to a specified location
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LLocatePointer\*O
\*VWidgetName [Component] [Destination]\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LLocatePointer\*O
command will move the pointer over any widget in the current
widget hierarchy. 
If only a \*VWidgetName\*L argument is supplied, the pointer will
be moved over the midpoint of that widget. Optionally, 
the pointer can move to the specified
component within a widget (for example, to a certain character in a 
text widget). The \*Vdestination\*O argument to \*LLocatePointer\*O
orders the automation code to move \*Eoff\*O of the given widget in a
the specified direction.
This option is very useful for synthesizing traversal within menus.
.IP "\*VWidget\*O" 14n
The XtName of the widget to be acted upon.
.IP "\*V[Component]\*O"
Particular component within the widget. See \*LComponentList(3X)\*O for
a full list of supported components.
.IP "\*V[Destination]\*O"
\*VDestination\*O can be either an integer correponding to an index within 
the \*Vcomponent\*O, or one of the following literals.
\*LOff\*O, \*LLeft\*O, \*LRight\*O, \*LDown\*O and \*LUp\*O 
will move the pointer off the widget specified in the direction specified. 
\*VOff\*O will take the quickest path possible.  In the case where the
component is \*LRListItem\*O, \*VDestination\*O refers to the visible list item
number (0 is the first visible element in the list; the list refers only
to visible items). A value of \*LMax\*O for
\*VDestination\*O in a List refers to the last visible item, 
while \*LMin\*O refers to the first visible item.
If the component is \*VRTextChar\*O, \*VDestination\*O refers to the visible
character position in the Text widget (0 is the first visible character).
A value of \*LMax\*O for \*VDestination\*O in a Text widget refers to the
area after the last visible character, while \*LMin\*O refers to the area
before the first visible character.

the \*EOSF/Motif Quality Assurance Test Suite User's Guide\*O.
.SH EXAMPLE
\*LLocatePointer List1 RListItem 2\*O
.PP
This will move the pointer over the 3rd Item in List1.
.PP 
\*LLocatePointer Text1 RTextChar Max\*O
.PP
This will move the pointer to the area after the last visible character
in Text1.
.PP
\*LLocatePointer\*O \*VCascadeButton1 Right\*O
.PP
This command will move the pointer off CascadeButton1 to the right.
This command is very useful in traversing menus.
.PP
\*LLocatePointer\*O \*VPulldown1 RTearOffButton\*O
.PP
This command will move to the TearOff button associated with the
Pulldown menu. The Pulldown menu needs to be visible and the TearOff
feature must be enabled.
