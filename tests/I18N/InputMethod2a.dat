/*
 * HISTORY
 */

#) This test, running with the "-I InputMethod2a.Dat -u a" option is for 
   testing how the Motif Text and TextField widgets react to an OverTheSpot 
   style Input Method, with per widget Input Context.
#) It is running with the LANG environment variable set to japanese.

C)

#) Testing the XmImGetXIM function.
#) The XmNinputMethod has not been set on the VendorShell, so it should be
   NULL, and the function should try to open an input method using the current
   locale.
#) If this failed, you will see a failure message in your term window and the
   test will exit. Else, you should see the following message in your term 
   window:
!)
      Input method opened successfully for locale <locale_name>.

      where <locale_name> should be japanese.

C)

#) Print the supported input styles of the open Input Method.
#) You will see in your term window the number of supported input styles,
   and their values.
#) If the Input Method cannot support an OverTheSpot style, print an error
   and exit. Else you should see the following message in your term window:
!)
      Input Method and Application support the same input style.
C)
 
#) A window should appear containing a Scrolled Text widget, a Text widget and 
   a TextField widget.
#) A panel should also appear, displaying information about the input style 
   currently tested, and resources to test for the Input Context.
#) Invoke the Input Method by pressing the <Extend char> key on the rigth of
   your space bar, while focus is in the Scrolled Text widget. The Status 
   area appears at the bottom left, outside the application window.
#) Move the input focus to the other widgets.
#) Go to the end of the word "Testing" in the Scrolled Text widget, and start 
   typing "fuji". When typing "f", the Preedit Area appears at the cursor 
   location, in reverse color, and displaying the letter "f". After typing 
   "u", you see a new character overriding the "f", which is the phonetic
   equivalent of the English letters "fu" in Hiragana. You will notice the
   same behavior while typing "ji".
#) Now press the <tab> key to get the Katakana symbols.
#) Press on the <Extend char> key on the left of your space bar, to enter the
   symbols in your text and get disconnected from the Input Method.
C)

#) Test the XmImSetValues function through XtSetValues of resources affecting
   the Input Context.
#) Invoke again the Input Method by pressing the rigth <Extend char> key.
#) Enter "to". A new phonetic symbol appears in the Preedit area.
#) Change the input focus to the other text widgets. The Preedit area is moved
   to the other widgets, preserving its contents.
#) Go back to the Scrolled Text widget. Select "Scrolled Text" in the 
   "Apply to" radio box of the Panel, and select "Yellow" from the
   "Background" pulldown. The background color of the Scrolled Text changes 
   to yellow as well as the Preedit area foreground and the Status area
   background.
#) Give the input focus to the other text widgets. The yellow color should
   not be maintained in the Preedit Area and in the Status Area, but should be
   matching the text widget's color.
#) Play with the other values of the different resources, in each widget.
#) Press the left <Extend char> key.
C)

#) Test that the widgets are using different Input Context.
#) You should see a message in your term window.
C)

#) Test the XmImUnregister function.
#) The Scrolled Text widget has been unregistered from the Input Method. 
#) While focus in the Scrolled Text widget, try to invoke the Input 
   Method. No Status area 
   should appear, and when typing no Preedit Area should appear.
