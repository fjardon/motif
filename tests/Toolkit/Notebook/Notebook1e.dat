 *  HISTORY
*/

#) This test should have been run with the flag "-u 5".
#) A Notebook will appear on your screen. All resources for this Notebook 
   have been set via the defaults file Notebook.defaults. 
   There will also be a control panel with which you can do a GetValues on
   those resources of the Notebook that are of type Dimension. (Since it
   may be hard to visually gauge what values these resources have been
   set to).
#) The width and height of Page 1 of the Notebook have been set to 400. This
   should be reflected in the size of the Notebook.
#) The width and height of MajorTab1 have both been set to 30.
#) The width and height of MinorTab1 have both been set to 30.
#) The orientation of the Notebook should be horizontal.
#) The placement of the back pages should top right.
#) The binding of the Notebook should be the GNU pixmap. This should be 
   constrained by the binding width, which is 20 pixels.
