# HISTORY
# 

#  @) This test uses a Scrolled Text widget and a SingleLine Text widget
#  to test various Text widget functions.  Almost all of the functions to
#  test can be found on a popup menu accessible by pressing MB3 in either
#  widget.
#  @) In the stdout window, there should now be several messages about
#  TextPositions and XY locations of various characters.  Verify that they
#  all are correct.
#  @) The SingleLine Text widget should have a string starting at character
#  position 3 reading \"**THIS TEXT INSERTED**\" that was inserted into
#  the original source after the widget was created.
CompareVisual Text2

#  #) Whenever a primary selection of any kind is made in either widget, a
#  callback is called that prints a message saying that it gained or lost the
#  primary selection ownership.  Verify that one message comes out in the stdout
#  window for every gain or loss of primary selection.
#  #) Whenever a selection is made in either widget and a function is chosen
#  off the popup menu, the selection's left and right character positions
#  are displayed in the stdout window.  If the widget does not own the Primary
#  selection or can not perform the operation for some reason, a message to
#  that affect will be printed in the stdout window.

#  #) The following functions are found on the popup menus.  Each one should be
#  tested in both widgets and between the widgets where appropriate:
#  !) 
#      Cut            - cuts primary selection to clipboard
#      Copy           - copies primary selection to clipboard
#      Paste          - pastes from clipboard to current
#                       cursor location
#      Remove         - deletes primary selection
#      HiLi Normal    - highlights 5 characters left of
#                       cursor location in normal mode (no
#                       highlight)
#      HiLi Selected  - highlights 5 characters left of
#                       cursor in selected mode (reverse
#                       video)
#      HiLi Secondary - highlights 5 characters left of
#                       cursor in secondary selected mode
#                       (underlined)
#      Scroll Up 2    - scrolls the text widget up 2 lines
#      Scroll Down 3  - scrolls the text widget down 2 lines
#      Toggle AddMode - toggles AddMode on and off
#                       (I-beam should be stippled)
#  
#                On the SingleLine Text widget only:
#  
#      Switch Source  - toggles the text source between its
#                       own original source and sharing the
#                       source used for the Scrolled Text
#                       widget.
