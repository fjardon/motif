@) A client with a list of functions, a control panel and a Text widget to 
be acted upon should appear.
#) Select the XmTextGetEditable() function from the Functions List by
clicking MB1 on it.
Click on the Call Function PushButton.
The current editing status of the Action Text widget will be shown in
the Status/Input widget.  The status will be True.  Confirm this by clicking MB1
in the Action text and deleting a few characters.
#) Select the XmTextSetEditable() function.  Set the True/False Arg
ToggleButton to False.  Click on the Call Function PushButton.
The Action Text widget's editable property will be toggled to False.
Select XmTextGetEditable() function and click the Call Function PushButton
again.  It should now show a value of False in the Status/Input widget.
Also, now try deleting some characters from the Action Text widget.
#) Make the Action Text widget editable again by selecting
XmTextSetEditable, setting the True/False Arg to True and clicking on
Call Function.
C)
#) Select the XmTextGetMaxLength() function and call it.
The value 27 will be reported in the Status widget.
#) Select the XmTextSetMaxLength() function from the list.
Set the Numerical Arg 1 Scale to 30.  Click the Call Function PushButton.
Now select the XmTextGetMaxLength() function.  The Status widget should 
read 30.
You should be able to add text to the Action
Text widget until its length is 30.
#) Select the XmTextGetLastPosition() function and call it.  It should
read 30.  Now delete a few characters from the Action Text and click Call
Function again.  It will now read a few less than 30.
C)
#) Select XmTextSetInsertionPosition() from the Functions List.  Set the
Numerical Arg 1 Scale to 3.  Click the Call Function PushButton.  The
insertion cursor in the Action Text should move between the 'i' and 's' in
'This' (assuming that part of the text is still intact).
C)
#) Select and call the XmTextGetBaseline() function.  It should read
something near 20 depending on the metrics of the 'variable' font in use.
#) Select the XmTextXYToPos() function.  Set the Num Arg 1 Scale to 14
and the Num Arg 2 Scale to 18.  Click the Call Function PushButton.
The Status/Input widget should read "Position = 1".  (The Num Arg 1
corresponds to the x argument and Num Arg 2 to the y argument.)
#) Set the Num Arg 2 Scale to a number about 4 larger than the value
returned by the earlier call to XmTextGetBaseline() (i.e. 24-26).
Click Call Function.  The Status widget should read the last position
in the string.  Verify this by scrolling up the Functions List and calling
XmTextGetLastPosition() again.
#) Select the XmTextPosToXY() function and set the Num Arg 1 Scale to 2.
Click the Call Function PushButton.  The Status widget should read something
like "x = 24, y = 20" (this will vary depending on the font metrics and what
the second character in the Action Text widget is).
C)
#) Select and call the XmTextGetTopCharacter() function.
The value returned in the Status widget should be 0.
#) Select the XmTextSetTopCharacter() function.  Set the Num Arg 1 Scale
to 6. Click the Call Function PushButton.  The text in the Action Text
widget should shift such that the first visible character on the left
is the seventh character in the string (origin of 0).
#) Set the Num Arg 1 Scale back to 0 and click Call Function again.  The
Action Text widget should return to its original appearance.
