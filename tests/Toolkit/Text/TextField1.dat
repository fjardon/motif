@) A client with a list of functions, a control panel and a TextField widget to 
be acted upon should appear.
#) Select the XmTextFieldGetEditable() function from the Functions List by
clicking MB1 on it.
Click on the Call Function PushButton.
The current editing status of the Action TextField widget will be shown in
the Status/Input widget.  The status will be True.  Confirm this by clicking MB1
in the Action TextField and deleting a few characters.
#) Select the XmTextFieldSetEditable() function.  Set the True/False Arg
ToggleButton to False.  Click on the Call Function PushButton.
The Action TextField widget's editable property will be toggled to False.
Select XmTextFieldGetEditable() function and click the Call Function PushButton
again.  It should now show a value of False in the Status/Input widget.
Also, now try deleting some characters from the Action TextField widget.
#) Make the Action TextField widget editable again by selecting
XmTextFieldSetEditable, setting the True/False Arg to True and clicking on
Call Function.
C)
#) Select the XmTextFieldGetMaxLength() function and call it.
The value 27 will be reported in the Status widget.
#) Select the XmTextFieldSetMaxLength() function from the list.
Set the Numerical Arg 1 Scale to 30.  Click the Call Function PushButton.
Now select the XmTextFieldGetMaxLength() function.  The Status widget should 
read 30.
You should be able to add text to the Action
TextField widget until its length is 30.
#) Select the XmTextFieldGetLastPosition() function and call it.  It should
read 30.  Now delete a few characters from the Action TextField and click Call
Function again.  It will now read a few less than 30.
C)
#) Select XmTextFieldSetInsertionPosition() from the Functions List.  Set the
Numerical Arg 1 Scale to 3.  Click the Call Function PushButton.  The
insertion cursor in the Action TextField should move between the 'i' and 's' in
'This' (assuming that part of the text is still intact).
C)
#) Select and call the XmTextFieldGetBaseline() function.  It should read
something near 20 depending on the metrics of the 'variable' font in use.
#) Select the XmTextFieldXYToPos() function.  Set the Num Arg 1 Scale to 14
and the Num Arg 2 Scale to 18.  Click the Call Function PushButton.
The Status/Input widget should read "Position = 1".  (The Num Arg 1
corresponds to the x argument and Num Arg 2 to the y argument.)
#) Set the Num Arg 2 Scale to a number about 4 larger than the value
returned by the earlier call to XmTextFieldGetBaseline() (i.e. 24-26).
Click Call Function.  The Status widget should read the same as it
did for the first call.  The Y value is unused for a TextField widget.
#) Select the XmTextFieldPosToXY() function and set the Num Arg 1 Scale to 2.
Click the Call Function PushButton.  The Status widget should read something
like "x = 24, y = 20" (this will vary depending on the font metrics and what
the second character in the Action TextField widget is).
E)
