#  @) The client window should have two TextField widgets and
#  one Text widget.
#  The first TextField has XmNresizeWidth set to False.  The second has
#  it set to True.  The Text widget also has it set to True.
#  /* test case for PIR 2914 */
#  #) Type "all the king's horses and all the king's men" into the first 
#  TextField widget.  For each character typed that exceeds the width
#  of the TextField, the text should shift to the left one character 
#  to keep the newly typed character in view.
