@) This test confirms that ToggleButton widgets and gadgets locate the toggle
indicators centered vertically regardless of the XmNlabelType
of the toggle and the indicator size, when XmNindicatorOn is true. 
@) You should see 8 pairs of toggle buttons, alternatively text and pixmap,
with the pairs each composed of a toggle widget and a toggle gadget.

#) The first pair (string) should appear with a large indicator matched 
to the size of the font. 
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The second pair (pixmap) should appear with a smaller indicator.
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The third pair (string) should appear without an indicator.
