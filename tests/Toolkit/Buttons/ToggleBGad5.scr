# HISTORY
#

# This is a test of the operation of the toggle button indicator.  
# A toggle button with a small pixmap and a push button should now be
# displayed.  Notice the size of the toggle indicator.

# Click MB1 on the push button labelled "Cycle Pixmaps".  The pixmap on the
# toggle button should change.  This pixmap will be larger than the
# original pixmap.  The indicator should resize itself to remain in
# proportion to the pixmap height.

# Click MB1 on the push button again.  Again, the pixmap will change and 
# the indicator will grow in proportion to its size.

# Click MB1 one more time.  The pixmap returns to its original size and the
# indicator shrinks along with it.

# A Menu Bar is generated which contains a pulldown menu.  Using MB1,
# press on the MENU cascade button on the Menu Bar and do not release the
# button.  The Pulldown menu appears.

# Notice that all of the toggle buttons in the Pulldown menu have the
# same indicator size.  Keeping MB1 pressed, move the pointer over
# "Button A".  Release MB1.

# Call up the pulldown menu again.  The label of the top button in the
# menu has been changed to "A New Label".  The indicator on this toggle 
# button should remain the same as the other buttons in the Pulldown menu.
