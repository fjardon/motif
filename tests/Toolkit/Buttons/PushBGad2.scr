# HISTORY

# A client with a pushbutton gadget should appear. It should be labeled
#  'Push Here'. All other resources will be set by default. 

# Click MB1 on the pushbutton. The pushbutton should set showAsDefault
#  to 5 which will place a second shadow region around the pushbutton
#  to visually mark it as a default button. 
# Click MB1 on the pushbutton again. Now, showAsDefault will be set at 10 and
#  and the shadow region around the pushbutton will grow to 10 pixels.
