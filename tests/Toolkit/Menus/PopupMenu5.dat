/* Pause 1 */
/* Test for PIR 2968 */

#) This test looks at the uses of XmNwhichButton and XmNmenuPost.  
#) A client should appear with two pushbuttons - "Popup with whichButton"
   and "Popup with menupost".  PopupMenus have been associated with the
   first pushButton via XmNwhichButton.  Two different popups should appear
   when pressing MB1 and MB3.  
#) PopupMenus have been associated with the second pushButton via XmNmenuPost.
   Two different popups should appear when pressing MB1 and MB3.  (Note: The 
   two popups for the first button should be different from the two popups 
   for the second button).
#) Verify that MB1 and MB3 presses in both buttons cause popups to be
   posted.
C) 

/* Pause 2 */
/* Another test for PIRs 2968 and 2972 */

#) Note that no warnings should appear in the term window.
#) The same test occurs; however, XmNmenuPost and XmNwhichButton have been
   specified at SetValues time.
#) Verify that MB1 and MB3 presses in both buttons cause popups to be
   posted.
C)

/* Pause 3 */
/* Another test for PIR 2972 */
	
#) Note that no warnings should appear in the term window.
#) A BulletinBoard with a PushButton will appear.  An event handler has been
   set for ButtonPress events on the PushButton and the BulletinBoard.  
   A popupMenu has been
   created as a child of the BulletinBoard.  The event handler will manage
   the popupMenu if MB3 has been pressed.

#) Click MB1 in the pushButton. The push button should press in and out.
   A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button 1".

#) Click MB3 in the pushButton.  A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button3".  A popupMenu
   should appear.  Use MB3 to pop down the popupMenu.

#) Now click MB1 and MB3 in the bulletinBoard, but not in the pushButton.
   Messages should be posted for both button clicks and the popup should
   be posted with MB3.
C)

/* Pause 4 */

#) Now whichButton has been set to 3 and there is NO event handler set for
   ButtonPress events on the Bulletin Board, just an event handler on the
   pushButton.  Therefore, the popupMenuhas been created as a child of
   the pushButton.

#) Click MB1 in the pushButton. The push button should press in and out.
   A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button 1".

#) Click MB3 in the pushButton.  A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button3".  A popupMenu
   should appear.  Use MB3 to pop down the popupMenu.

#) Now click MB1 and MB3 in the bulletinBoard, but not in the pushButton.
   No messages should appear in the term window; no effect should happen from
   selecting in the bulletinBoard.
C)

/* Pause 5 */
/* Another test for PIR 2972 */

#) Note that no warnings should appear in the term window.
#) MenuPost has been set to "<Btn3>", an event handler has been set on both
   the bulletinBoard and the PushButton.  The popupMenu has been created
   as a child of the bulletinBoard.
#) Click MB1 in the PushButton.  The pushButton should go in and out.
   A message should appear in the term window, "menuPost = 3, handler 
   called for Button 1".
#) Click MB3 in the PushButton.  The popupMenu should post.  A message should
   appear in the term window, "menuPost = 3, handler called for Button 3".
   Use MB3 to dismiss the popupMenu.
#) The same MB1 and MB3 events should occur when selecting in the
   bulletinBoard.
C)

/* Pause 6 */
/* Test for PIR 2967 */

#) MenuPost = Btn3.  An event handler has been set on the pushButton only.
   The popupMenu has been created as a child of the pushButton.  
#) Select MB1 in the pushButton.  The pushButton should go in and out.  A
   message should appear in the term window, "menuPost = 3, handler called
   for Button 1".
#) Select MB3 in the pushButton.  The popupMenu should appear.  A message
   should appear in the term window, "menuPost = 3, handler called for Button 
   3".  Use MB3 to dismiss the popupMenu.
#) Selecting MB1 and MB3 should have no effect within the BulletinBoard.
C)

/* Pause 7 */
/* PIR 3432 */

#) MenuPost = Btn3.  An event handler has been set on the bulletinBoard only.
   The popupMenu has been created as a child of the BulletinBoard.  Press MB1
   in the pushButton.  It should go in and out.  NO message should appear in
   the  term window.
#) Press MB3 in the PushButton.  A popupMenu should appear and a message should
   appear in the term window.
#) Pressing MB1 should have no effect in the BulletinBoard, however
   messages from the event handler should appear in the term window. 
#) Press MB3 in the BulletinBoard.  A popupMenu should be posted.  A 
   message should appear in the term window.
