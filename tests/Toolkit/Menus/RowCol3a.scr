# HISTORY

# The RowColumn has been created as a child of a BulletinBoard widget.

# /* PIR 3192 */

# Verify that if XmNentryBorder has been set to a non-zero value and then
#  subsequently gets set back to 0, the SetValues of 0 works.  Do this by
#  changing Button Label String to "new value" and pressing Return.
#  Note that the client window will now contain a pushButton with "new
#  value" as its label.

# Now add several more children by moving the Number of Children slider
#  to 5.  The client window should now have 5 pushButton children.
#  Change XmNentryBorder to be greater than zero by moving the
#  slider next to it.  The client window should reflect this change.
#  Now move the slider back to zero.  The client window should change so
#  that XmNentryBorder is 0.

# Verify that children can be added on-the-fly to the RowColumn and they
#  actually appear where they are supposed to. 

#  Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset Panel
#  pushButton.  Use the Number of Children slider to create 2 additional
#  children (set it to three).  The RowColumn should grow in the vertical
#  direction and two new pushbutton children, labeled 2 and 3 should appear.

# Incrementally increase the value of XmNentryBorder.  Make sure that the

# Verify that updating XmNorientation from HORIZONTAL to VERTICAL works.

# Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset Panel
#  pushButton.  Change the XmNorientation to be HORIZONTAL.  Now change
#  Number of Children to be 5.  Change XmNmarginWidth, XmNmarginHeight
#  and XmNspacing to be 5.  The RowColumn should be displaying all of
#  this appropriately.

# Now change XmNorientation to XmVERTICAL.  The RowColumn should update
#  correctly.

Continue

# /* PIR 3454 */

# Verify that on-the-fly changing of XmNpacking works.

# Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset Panel
#  pushButton.  Set XmNpacking to XmPACK_COLUMN and XmNnumColumns to 3.
#  Set Number of Children to 6.  

# The client RowColumn should display a 3 X 2 matrix, with 1, 3, and 5
#  across the top row and 2, 4 and 6 across the bottom row.

# Change XmNpacking to XmPACK_TIGHT.  Since the orientation is vertical,
#  the RowColumn should display entries 1 through 6 in a vertical fashion,
#  in one column.

Continue

# /* PIR 3459 */

# Verify that setting XmNwidth when XmNresizeWidth = True causes no
#  change in the RowColumn.

# Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset Panel
#  pushButton.  

# Create several kids (like 11) of the rowColumn.  Packing should be 
#  XmPACK_COLUMN, orientation should be XmVERTICAL.  Set XmNnumColumns to
#  3.

# Specify an XmNwidth of 400.  The right most children should not become
#  clipped.  Select one of the rightmost children.  The term window should
#  print the child's width and height.  The width should not be 400.

Continue

# /* PIR 3464 */

# Verify PACK_TIGHT mode (XmNorientation = XmVERTICAL).

# Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset panel
#  pushButton.

# Set XmNorientation to XmVERTICAL, XmNresizeHeight to False (or 'off'),
#  XmNpacking to XmPACK_TIGHT, and XmNheight to 400.  The RowColumn should
#  become 400 pixels high.

# Set Number of Children to 14.  The children should fit into the RowColumn.
#  Now set Number of Children to 15.  The RowColumn should place child 15
#  in the next column, wrapping in the minor dimension.

Continue

# Verify PACK_TIGHT mode (XmNorientation = XmHORIZONTAL).

# Reset the RowColumn back to its initial state by using the Reset panel
#  pushButton.

# Set XmNorientation to XmHORIZONTAL, XmNresizeWidth to False (or 'off'),
#  XmNpacking to XmPACK_TIGHT, and XmNwidth to 400.  The RowColumn should
#  become 400 pixels wide.

# Set Number of Children to 16.  The children should fit into the RowColumn.
#  Now set Number of Children to 17.  The RowColumn should place child 17
#  in the next row, wrapping in the minor dimension.
