# /* Pause 1 */
# /* Test for PIR 2968 */

# This test looks at the uses of XmNwhichButton and XmNmenuPost.  

# A client should appear with two pushbuttons - "Popup with whichButton"
#  and "Popup with menupost".  PopupMenus have been associated with the
#  first pushButton via XmNwhichButton.  Two different popups should appear
#  when pressing MB1 and MB3.  

# PopupMenus have been associated with the second pushButton via XmNmenuPost.
#  Two different popups should appear when pressing MB1 and MB3.
#  (Note: The two popups for the first button should be different from
#  the two popups for the second button).

# Verify that MB1 and MB3 presses in both buttons cause popups to be
#  posted.

# A BulletinBoard with a PushButton will appear.  An event handler has been

#  A popupMenu has been
#  created as a child of the BulletinBoard.  The event handler will manage
#  the popupMenu if MB3 has been pressed.

# Click MB1 in the pushButton. The push button should press in and out.
#  A message should appear in the term window,
#  saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button 1".

# Click MB3 in the pushButton.  A message should appear in the term window,
#  saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button3".  A popupMenu
#  should appear.  Use MB3 to pop down the popupMenu.

# Now click MB1 and MB3 in the bulletinBoard, but not in the pushButton.
#  Messages should be posted for both button clicks and the popup should
#  be posted with MB3.

# Now whichButton has been set to 3 and there is NO event handler set for
#  ButtonPress events on the Bulletin Board, just an event handler on the
#  pushButton.  Therefore, the popupMenu has been created as a child of
#  the pushButton.

# Click MB1 in the pushButton. The push button should press in and out.
#  A message should appear in the term window,
#  saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button 1".

# Click MB3 in the pushButton.  A message should appear in the term window,
#  saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button3".  

# Now click MB1 and MB3 in the bulletinBoard, but not in the pushButton.
#  No messages should appear in the term window; no effect should happen from
#  selecting in the bulletinBoard.
