# OSF/Motif: @(#)List2.scr	1.2  91/10/11
# Screen 1
# This test will contain a form with three children, a Scrolled List,
# a RowColumn with settable resources, and another RowColumn with
# Callback Information. 

# The Scrolled List will contain 28 items, 18 which are initially
# visible. It will have a background color of wheat.

# The middle panel will contain scales, Option Menus, a Toggle Button,
# and a PushButton. These widgets will control resources for the 
# Scrolled List. For instance to change the visibleItemCount of the
# List you should move the scale to the value you wish and a SetValues()
# will be performed on that resource.
# The last PushButton in the middle panel (orchid background color)
# will destroy and re-create the Scrolled List with the resource
# values currently shown in the resource area.

# The right side RowColumn contains callback information for the Scrolled
# List. The Panel's background color will be cyan. The Panel will be updated
# any time a callback has been called in the List. The panel will fill
# in callback information conditionally on what the selection Policy is.
# Fields that are not available for a certain selection Policy will be
# marked as N/A.

# Output to STDOUT will contain a DUMP of the entire heirarchy in this
# test.
