/**** NOTE:
 ***  This script supports two tests, Navigation2 and Navigation10.
 ***  If you change it, you may need to rerecord both.
 ***/

#) This is a test of traversal behaviours.  
#Nine Forms should appear within a Form. 
#Each child Form should contain a 3x3 matrix of PushButtons. 
#) Pressing the TAB or Shift-TAB will result on the focus moving 
#from one form to another. 
#) Pressing the up/down left/right arrow keys will result in traversal 
#within the current form. 
#) Clicking MB1 on the PushButtons should make them disappear. Click MB1 
#on the PushButtons of any of the Forms until they all go away. 
#) Try TABbing between the remaining Forms.
