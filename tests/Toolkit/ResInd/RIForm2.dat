 * HISTORY
 */
#) Press the pushbutton Create Option Menu.  An option menu should be
   created and displayed in the top left corner of the client window.
   The option menu should be totally visible.
C)

#) A client with a form should appear. The form should
   contain one pushbutton labeled 'pushB'. 
#) Select the pushbutton several times. Selecting the pushbutton
   will invoke a callback that will print the current width and
   height of the pushbutton and will increase the width and height
   of the pushbutton. The form disallows this increase, so the form
   should not grow. 
C)
#) The original form should be destroyed, and in its place a form
   which contains three PushButtons should appear. Push0 should be 
   located in the top left corner, Push1 should be located in the
   top right corner, and Push2 should be located across the bottom
   of the form.
#) Resize the client window to the right so that Push1 and Push2
   move to the right.
#) Click MB1 on Push1, Push1 should grow larger.
