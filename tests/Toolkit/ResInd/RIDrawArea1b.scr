#  a label "Resize Drawn Button", with arrowButtons on both sides;
#  a square Box;  two toggle buttons, "Resize Child" and "Resize Parent".

# This is a test of the resize callback.
# Five messages about resize callback should appear in the xterm window.
#  The messages are numbered to help you keep track of them.
# The toggles at the bottom let you choose between resizing the Parent of
#  the Drawing Area -- a form -- and one of its children, the Drawn button.
#  In this test, the Drawn button appears as a square box.

# This test is being run in BBForm mode. The UP arrow will INCREASE the 
#  size of the parent or child (depending on
#  which toggle is set). The DOWN arrow will DECREASE the size.

Continue

# Increase the child size several times. It should not force the Drawing
#  Area to resize until its right edge has to move beyond the right edge of
#  the rightmost arrow button.

# Once you reach the edge of the drawing area, each increase in the size of

# Decrease the size of the child several times. At some point, the Drawing
#  Area will stop growing smaller. At this point, no more resize callback
#  messages should appear as you decrease the child's size.
