#) This is a test testing the setting and inheriting of all the
   geometry related WMShell resources.

#) There should be a control panel shown with all the resources available
   to be set by the user. 

C)

#) There should be a new option menu in the control panel with the label
   "Apply Changes To". Also, the option menu should have "ApplicationShell",
   as the selected item,  with "TopShell", and "DialogShell" items being 
   insensitive.

#) Also, a new window with title "ApplicationShell", containing a pushbutton
   should appear on the screen.

#) To change the WMShell resources for the ApplicationShell, modify the
   various scale values, and then click on "ApplicationShell" item of the
   option menu. The ApplicationShell window should unmap and remap. 
   Depending on the resources you have changed, you should be able to check
   their new values by performing various window manager operations on
   the ApplicationShell window. (for example, with no iconBox, if you have 
   set new values for iconX and/or iconY, you should be able to check it 
   by iconifying the window, and noting the position of the icon on the 
   screen.)

C)

#) There should now be a new window with title "TopLevelShell", containing 
   a pushbutton.Also, the item "TopLevelShell" in the option menu should 
   be sensitive now.

#) To change the WMShell resources for the TopLevelShell, modify the
   various scale values, and then click on "TopLevelShell" item of the
   option menu. The TopLevelShell window should unmap and remap. 
   Depending on the resources you have changed, you should be able to check
   their new values by performing various window manager operations on
   the TopLevelShell window. (for example, with no iconBox, if you have 
   set new values for iconX and/or iconY, you should be able to check it 
   by iconifying the window, and noting the position of the icon on the 
   screen.)

#) To apply the changes to both the shells, select "All Shells" from the
   option menu.

C)

#) There should now be a modeless dialog box displayed. Also, the item
   "DialogShell" in the option menu should be sensitive now.

#) To change the WMShell resources for the DialogShell, modify the
   various scale values, and then click on "DialogShell" item of the
   option menu. The DialogShell window should unmap and remap. 
   Depending on the resources you have changed, you should be able to check
   their new values by performing various window manager operations on
   the DialogShell window. 

#) To apply the changes to all the three shells, select "All Shells" from 
   the option menu.
