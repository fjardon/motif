@) Try the following steps.
#) Only Child1 is visible.
#) Attach the TOP edge of Child2 to WIDGET. Child2 appears below Child1.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of Child2 to FORM. Child2 resizes to the size of
the Form.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of Child2 to WIDGET. Child2 disappears.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of Child2 to OPPOSITE_WIDGET. Child2 reappears the
same size as Child1.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of Child1 to FORM. The edge of Child2, which is
attached to the right edge of Child1, should resize with it.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of Child1 to POSITION-6.  The Form should resize
larger so that the buttons fill 60% of the form.
C)
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of BUTTON2 to SELF. Note that the corresponding label
in the bottom pane shows "ATTACH_POSITION".
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of BUTTON1 to FORM. The edges of the two buttons are
no longer attached, so PushButton2 should NOT resize.
#) Attach the LEFT edge of BUTTON1 to WIDGET. The form will resize very 
small and a warning about circular attachments will appear.
#) Attach the LEFT edge of BUTTON1 to FORM. The form resizes so the buttons
are visible.
#) Attach the RIGHT edge of BUTTON2 to POSITION-4. The form grows and Push
Button1 continues to fill the form left-to-right.
C)
!) Error Conditions.
#) Attach the BOTTOM of BUTTON1 to ATTACH_WIDGET.
#) In stdout, you should see an error message.
@) Warning: 
   Name: form
   Class: XmForm
   Circular dependency in Form children.
#) Use the two CLEAR buttons to reset both buttons.
#) Attach the BOTTOM of BUTTON1 to POSITION-8. Child2 is not visible and
the form will grow slightly.
C)
!) More error conditions.
#) Attach LEFT edge of BUTTON2 to WIDGET. Child2 appears to the right of
Child1.
#) Attach RIGHT edge of BUTTON2 to WIDGET.
#) This is an impossible case to render, so Button2 will disappear and
the following message appears in stdout:
@) Warning: 
@)    Name: form
@)    Class: XmForm
@)    Circular dependency in Form children.
#) Use the CLEAR buttons to reset. 
C)
#) Got the idea? You can experiment for awhile.
#) Use the CLEAR keys to reset things.
E)
