   contain one pushbutton labeled 'pushB'.

   the fraction base to zero and an X Toolkit Warning is displayed in
   the term window.

#) Press MB1 on the pushbutton. A callback will set the form width
   to 200 and height to 300. The form should change to
   to these sizes.

   width to 0 and height to 0. This signals the form
   to resize itself to contain its children. The form will resize
