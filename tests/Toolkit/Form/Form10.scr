#) The form will now have top/bottom/left/right Attachment set to
#)   XmATTACH_POSITION, and the pushbutton will have a leftPosition of
#)   10, a rightPosition of 90, a topPosition of 25, and a
#)   bottomPosition of 75. 
#) Note that the above resource settings would result in a
#)   pushbutton widget which was centered in the form, and was 80% as
#)   wide as the form, and 50% as tall as the form.  However, since
#)   the offsets set earlier are still in effect, the pushbutton will
#)   be further indented 10 from the top, 30 from the bottom, 20 from
#)   the left, and 40 from the right of the form.

#  500x100 pixels, and should have three arrowButtons within
#  it.  The form will have left/right Attachment set to
#  XmATTACH_POSITION, and topAttachment set to XmATTACH_FORM for
#  the first two arrows and bottomAttachment set to XmATTACH_FORM
#  for the third arrow.  The  first arrow will have a leftPosition
#  of 10, a rightPosition of 30, and a topOffset of 20.  The second
#  arrow will have a leftPosition of 40, a rightPosition of 60, and
#  a topOffset of 0.  The third arrow will have a leftPosition of
#  70, a rightPosition of 90, and a bottomOffset of 5.

#  Note that the above resource settings will result in ArrowButton
#  widgets which are each 20% as wide as the form, and separated
#  horizontally from the form and each other by a space 10% as wide
#  as the form.  In addition, the first two widgets will each be
#  offset from the top of the form, and the third widget will be
#  offset from the bottom of the form, by the amounts listed above.

#  Resize the client several times. You should see the arrows move
#  and resize,  but retain the same relative horizontal positions
#  and sizes.
