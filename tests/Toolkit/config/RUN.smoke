# XFILESEARCHPATH mechanism for using the defaults file in each directory.
# First check to see if the variable is already set. If it is, save it.
# The, set XFILESEARCHPATH to $cwd/$cwd:t.defaults.

# The following are report generation related RUN variables.
# The format for specifying will be as follows:

#    RUN.smoke -genrep <report_switch>

#     -Dir	 - Generates a directory level report
#     -test  - Generates a test level report
#     -panel - Generates a panel level report
