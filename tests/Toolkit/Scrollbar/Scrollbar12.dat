@)  The following panels test the snapback scrolling feature.

#)  A vertical scrollbar should be displayed. The XmNsnapBackMultiple resource
    is set to its default value, which means the scrollbar slider should
    move as long as pointer is within the bounds of a reasonable screen size.
    Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider. While continuing to hold down MB1,
    move the pointer horizontally outside the bounds of the scrollbar. Continue
    to press MB1 while moving the slider in the vertical direction.
    The scrollbar slider should continue to move. 

C)

#)  XmNsnapBackMultiple has been set to zero. The scrollbar slider should
    snap back to its original position once the pointer is moved outside
    the bounds of the scrollbar.  Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider.
    Drag the pointer vertically while continuing the hold down MB1 and
    then drag the pointer horizontally outside the bounds of the scrollbar.
    Verify that the scrollbar slider returns to its original position.

C)

#)  XmNsnapBackMultiple has been set to one. 
    Vertical separators should appear at the distance of one scrollbar 
    to both the left and the right of the scrollbar.
    The scrollbar slider should snap back to its original position
    once the pointer is moved beyond the region enclosed by the vertical
    separators. Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider.
    Drag the pointer vertically while continuing the hold down MB1 and
    then drag the pointer horizontally outside the width of the scrollbar
    but still within the region bracketed by the vertical separators.
    Move the pointer vertically, the scrollbar slider should move up and
    down.  Continuing to press MB1, move the pointer outside the region
    bracketed by the separators.  Verify that the scrollbar slider
    returns to its original position once the pointer crosses the
    bounds of one of the separators.

C)

#)  XmNsnapBackMultiple has been set to two.
    Vertical separators should appear at the distance of two scrollbars
    to both the left and the right of the scrollbar.
    The scrollbar slider should snap back to its original position
    once the pointer is moved beyond the region enclosed by the vertical
    separators. Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider.
    Drag the pointer vertically while continuing the hold down MB1 and
    then drag the pointer horizontally outside the region bracketed by
    the vertical separators.
    Verify that the scrollbar slider returns to its original position
    once the pointer crosses the bounds of one of the separators.

C)

#)  The scrollbar should now be displayed horizontally. 
    The XmNsnapBackMultiple resource is set to 1000 which should be
    equivalent to the default value, meaning the scrollbar slider should
    move as long as pointer is within the bounds of a reasonable screen size.
    Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider. While continuing to hold down MB1,
    move the pointer horizontally outside the bounds of the scrollbar. Continue
    to press MB1 while moving the slider in the vertical direction.
    The scrollbar slider should continue to move.

#)  XmNsnapBackMultiple has been set to zero. The scrollbar slider should
    snap back to its original position once the pointer is moved outside
    the bounds of the scrollbar.  Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider.
    Drag the pointer horizontally while continuing the hold down MB1 and
    then drag the pointer vertically outside the bounds of the scrollbar.
    Verify that the scrollbar slider returns to its original position.

C)

#)  XmNsnapBackMultiple has been set to one. 
    Horizontal separators should appear at the distance of one scrollbar 
    to above and below the scrollbar widget. 
    The scrollbar slider should snap back to its original position
    once the pointer is moved beyond the region enclosed by the horizontal
    separators. Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider.
    Drag the pointer horizontally while continuing the hold down MB1 and
    then drag the pointer vertically outside the width of the scrollbar
    but still within the region bracketed by the horizontal separators.
    Move the pointer horizontally, the scrollbar slider should move back and
    forth.  Continuing to press MB1, move the pointer outside the region
    bracketed by the separators.  Verify that the scrollbar slider
    returns to its original position once the pointer crosses the
    bounds of one of the separators.
